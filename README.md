Project Overview
Project Duration: March 2024 - April 2024

Project Description:
DiaSense is an advanced system developed to predict diabetes risk by utilizing machine learning 
models to analyze health data provided by users. The system aims to help individuals understand 
their risk of developing diabetes and offers insights for better health management.

Key Features
1. User Health Data Input
Users can input a variety of health metrics into DiaSense, including but not limited to:
• Blood sugar levels
• Body mass index (BMI)
• Age
• Family history of diabetes
• Physical activity levels
• Dietary habits
             etc.

3. Machine Learning-Based Risk Prediction
DiaSense uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to process the input data and predict 
the user's risk of developing diabetes. The system:
• Utilizes multiple machine learning models to ensure high accuracy.
• Compares different models to select the best performing one.
• Continuously improves its predictive capabilities through iterative learning.

4. Model Comparison
DiaSense provides a feature for comparing different machine learning models, allowing users to:
• View the performance metrics of various models.
• Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
• Select the most suitable model based on personalized needs and preferences.

DiaSense enhances user understanding and engagement through intuitive and interactive 
visualizations:
• Graphs and charts illustrating health trends and risk factors.
• Visual comparison of historical data with current metrics.
• Clear, easy-to-understand visual feedback on predicted diabetes risk.

6. Text-to-Speech Functionality
DiaSense includes a text-to-speech feature to ensure accessibility for all users, including those 
with visual impairments:
• Reads out predictions and insights aloud.
• Provides audio descriptions of visual data.
• Facilitates user interaction through voice commands.

7. Future Risk Prediction
DiaSense goes beyond current risk assessment by predicting the probability of developing 
diabetes in the future:
• Offers insights into potential long-term health outcomes.
• Suggests preventive measures based on predictive analysis.
• Encourages proactive health management through early detection.
